Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural-language generation.

The history of NLP generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods. In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.

In the early days, many language-processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power and the gradual accumulation of a vast amount of textual data, which provided the necessary data for machine learning methods.

Early machine learning algorithms applied to NLP were decision trees, but statistical models, especially those based on statistical inference, provided better results. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in NLP. Popular techniques include word embeddings, like word2vec, and the Transformer model, introduced in a paper titled "Attention is All You Need", which led to the development of pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT.

Modern NLP algorithms are based on machine learning, especially deep learning methods. Machine learning algorithms for NLP have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy for a variety of tasks, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and question-answering systems. Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific applications, making NLP models increasingly versatile and effective.
